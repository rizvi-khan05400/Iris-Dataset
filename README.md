# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Project - Iris Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Iris dataset** to understand its structure, features, and relationships.  
The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three Iris flower species: *Setosa, Versicolor,* and *Virginica*.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed
1. **Data Import & Exploration**
   - Loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame.
   - Checked data types, missing values, duplicates, and dataset shape.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing/null values.
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Detected and treated outliers using the **IQR method**.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles).
   - Distribution plots (histograms, KDE).
   - Boxplots for outlier detection.
   - Scatterplots & pairplots to visualize relationships.
   - Heatmap for correlation analysis.

4. **Insights**
   - *Setosa* is easily separable due to small petal size.
   - *Versicolor* and *Virginica* overlap in some features but differ in petal dimensions.
   - Petal length & width are the most important features for classification.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** â†’ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn (optional)** â†’ For potential ML classification

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
The analysis provided a clear understanding of the Iris dataset:
- It is **clean, balanced, and well-structured**.
- Strong separation exists among species based on **petal features**.
- The dataset is highly suitable for **classification models** like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs.
